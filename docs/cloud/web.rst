:edb-alt-title: Using Gel Cloud via the web GUI

Gel Cloud is shutting down. The web console remains available only so existing
customers can log in and export their data. Use it to retrieve a secret key if
needed, then follow :ref:`ref_guide_cloud` to dump your data and restore it to
a self-managed deployment. The UI no longer allows creating new organizations
or instances.
