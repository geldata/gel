:edb-alt-title: Deploying applications built on Gel Cloud

Gel Cloud is shutting down and new deployments are no longer supported. Use
your existing secret key (or generate one with
:ref:`ref_cli_gel_cloud_secretkey_create`) only to export data from your
hosted instance. Deploy your application against a self-managed Gel instance
using the guides in :ref:`ref_guide_deployment`.
